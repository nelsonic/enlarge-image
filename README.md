enlarge-image
=============

Simple script displays larger version of an image when a thumbnail clicked

## Background

Today I was handed a requirement to *dispaly* an **enlarged** an image 
**when** a **thumbnail** is *clicked*.

I *audaciously* proclaimed I could ***build*** the solution in the time it would 
take a fellow developer to *find* a suitable 3rd party module.

After a bit of googling my esteemed colleague found:

>[Lokesh Dhakar's](http://lokeshdhakar.com) **Lightbox2**: 
http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/

Review of the **GitHub** https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2 page indicates
Lightbox2 is **325 lines** of **JS** and (244+529) **773 lines** of **CSS**!
Why so much...?
